- What problems do they see with the ‘Synoptic Problem’?

#### **The Synoptic Problem**
The "Synoptic Problem" refers to the question of how to explain the similarities and differences among the Synoptic Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Scholars observe that these gospels often contain parallel material, sometimes word-for-word, but also include unique content. Theories about their relationships (e.g., which gospel was written first and what sources they used) lead to debates over authorship, composition, and historical reliability.

In Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels essays 3-5 deal with the critics of the gospels and their theories. Each gives answers to these theories. Either working alone or in a group, choose an essay: “Source criticism”, “Form Criticism”, or “Redaction Criticism” to read and then answer these questions:

Your formatting and phrasing are clear and well-structured. If you're satisfied with this approach, it works perfectly for providing concise yet precise definitions. Here's a minor refinement for flow:

- **What is source, form, or redaction criticism?**  
The definition of **source criticism** is at the bottom of page 274: *"This method investigates the written sources that gospel writers may have used, such as the theory that Mark or a hypothetical 'Q' document served as sources for Matthew and Luke."*  
The definition of **form criticism** is at the bottom of page 280: *"This approach examines the oral traditions behind the gospel accounts, classifying them into literary forms (e.g., parables, miracles) to study their historical and cultural origins."*  
The definition of **redaction criticism** is in the second paragraph of page 287: *"This method analyzes how gospel writers edited and arranged their material to emphasize specific theological themes or address the needs of their audiences."*

- How does it fail to explain the material in the gospels?  

1. **Source Criticism**: It relies on speculative sources like "Q" without direct evidence and overlooks the role of oral tradition.  
2. **Form Criticism**: It assumes the gospel material is fragmented and dismisses the reliability of oral tradition in preserving accurate history.  
3. **Redaction Criticism**: It exaggerates the editorial role of gospel writers, undermining their historical reliability.  

- What is the answer to this type of criticism?

1. **Source Criticism**: The gospels rely on trustworthy oral tradition and eyewitness testimony, guided by divine inspiration.  
2. **Form Criticism**: The gospels are unified, reliable narratives, not fragmented oral traditions.  
3. **Redaction Criticism**: The gospel writers emphasized theology while preserving historical truth.

Read Benware, Survey of the New Testament pp. 40-43 beginning with *“A Comparison of the Four Gospels.”*  

- What is the synoptic problem, the proposed solutions and the historic view of the church?

The Synoptic Problem explores the similarities and differences between Matthew, Mark, and Luke, with proposed solutions like Markan priority (Mark as the first gospel) and the hypothetical "Q" source, while the historic church view emphasizes the gospels' divine inspiration and reliance on eyewitness testimony.

- Write an “I believe” statement"  
*“I believe that the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, though very similar in content and structure, are divinely inspired. They were written at the proper time to address the specific needs of their respective audiences, offering edification and hope to persecuted saints. God's providence ensured their unique yet harmonious accounts, demonstrating His intentional design to deliver the Living Word to generations of believers. These gospels provide encouragement, hope, and the foundation for salvation, affirming that "faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God" (Romans 10:17).”*

Matthew 8:2-4, Mark 1:40-45 and Luke 5:12-16 are considered to be an example of the same event in each of the synoptic gospels. Read Thomas and Gundry, *A Harmony of the Gospels p. 53.*  

- Note the similarities between them. What differences can you find?

### Similarities:
- **Core Event**: All three accounts describe the same event—a leper approaches Jesus, requests healing, and Jesus heals him by touching him and declaring him clean.  
- **Messianic Miracle**: Each gospel highlights this as a miraculous act, fulfilling messianic expectations. Jesus directs the healed leper to show himself to the priests as a testimony, referencing the Mosaic Law.  
- **Audience-Specific Relevance**: The event is particularly meaningful for Jewish audiences (as Matthew emphasizes) because the act of showing oneself to the priests symbolized the validation of Jesus as the Messiah, something Romans and Greeks might not grasp.

### Differences:
- **Details in Luke**: The Gospel of Luke provides additional context about Jesus’ actions afterward, such as His withdrawal to pray in solitude after the miracle.  
- **Narrative Focus**:  
   - Matthew focuses on the messianic significance for Jewish readers.  
   - Mark emphasizes the growing publicity of Jesus’ ministry as the healed man spreads the news widely, even though Jesus instructs him not to.  
   - Luke highlights Jesus' personal habits, such as His tendency to withdraw for prayer after impactful events.
  
- What does the way Jesus deals with lepers tell us about Jesus’ concerns of those of the culture in which He lived?
The way Jesus deals with lepers demonstrates His disregard for cultural stigmas and Pharisaic oral laws regarding ritual uncleanliness, highlighting His divine authority and compassion. By touching the leper, Jesus showed that He was not affected by the leper's impurity but instead conveyed purity and healing, prioritizing the restoration of individuals over societal or religious taboos.

- Why would touching be significant to each of the authors given what you know about them? Why do you think that Mark gives more detail?

### Significance of Touching in Each Gospel
1. **Matthew**:  
   Touching the leper emphasizes Jesus’ authority as the Messiah, fulfilling Jewish expectations and demonstrating His power to restore both physical and spiritual purity. This resonates with Matthew’s Jewish audience, showing Jesus as the one who transcends ceremonial law.

2. **Mark**:  
   Mark’s emphasis on Jesus’ touch highlights His compassion and direct engagement with human suffering. Mark often portrays Jesus as a man of action, and the detailed description serves to show the immediacy and intensity of Jesus’ miracles, appealing to his likely Gentile audience who valued tangible demonstrations of power.

3. **Luke**:  
   Luke, a physician, underscores the humanity of Jesus and His willingness to physically engage with the marginalized. The act of touching reflects Luke’s broader theme of Jesus’ concern for outcasts and His role as the compassionate Savior for all people.

### Why Does Mark Give More Detail?
Mark’s gospel is action-oriented, often emphasizing vivid details to engage his audience. The additional detail in Mark could also reflect Peter’s firsthand account, as Mark is believed to have drawn from Peter’s testimony. The detail enhances the narrative’s immediacy and emotional impact, helping the reader feel the gravity of the miracle and Jesus’ defiance of cultural norms.
