### Session 8 Part 1

After reading Luke 1:1-4, state what is already known about Luke and Theophilus.  
*"Luke a practitioner of medicine, and is also a meticulous investigator and writer who seeks to provide Theophilus, a person of high status, with a trustworthy and well-ordered account of Jesus’ life, confirming the teachings Theophilus had already received."*  

How do you think that the book of Acts continues Luke’s purposes in his Gospel?  
*"The book of Acts continues Luke’s purpose by documenting the spread of the gospel after Jesus’ resurrection, showing how His teachings and mission were carried out through the apostles and the early church. Acts provides an orderly account of how the Holy Spirit empowered believers to witness “to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1:8), fulfilling the gospel's promise of salvation for all men. Like the Gospel of Luke, Acts emphasizes historical accuracy, inclusion of Gentiles, and assurance for Theophilus regarding the truth of Christianity."*  

Please cite any ways we have used Acts to complete the story of the gospels.  
*"Acts completes the story of the Gospels by showing how Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection set the foundation for the church’s mission. The acts of the early church—such as missionary work, charity, feeding the poor, caring for orphans, and providing services like hospitals—have inspired Christian service throughout history. These ongoing efforts reflect the early church’s faithfulness in living out the teachings of Christ and carrying His mission to the world."*

### Session 8 Part 2: ACTS

What in Acts seems similar to Luke to you? The key verse is *Acts 1:8* and should be a memory verse.  
*"Acts mirrors Luke’s emphasis on the Holy Spirit, prayer, inclusivity, and the mission to spread the gospel universally. Together, they provide a seamless narrative of Jesus’ ministry and the birth of the church, with Acts 1:8 serving as the pivotal mission statement for both the early church and all Christians."*  

### **Memory Verse: Acts 1:8 (NASB 2020)**  
*"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and as far as the remotest part of the earth."*  
 

How does Acts 1:8 predicate the development of this history?  
*"Acts 1:8 provides a prophetic outline for the events in Acts and serves as the foundation for the church’s mission throughout history. It demonstrates the progression from a small group of disciples in Jerusalem to a global movement, empowered by the Holy Spirit and rooted in the witness of Jesus Christ. This mission continues to shape Christian outreach and the expansion of God’s kingdom to this day."*  

Compare the **outlines** of *Benware, Survey of the New Testament* and *Nelson, Maps and Charts* to see the logic of Luke’s writing and the emphases of the Acts of the Apostles.  
*"Both outlines align in showing Luke’s structured narrative, driven by the fulfillment of Jesus’ command in Acts 1:8. Benware emphasizes leadership transitions and the church’s organizational growth, while Nelson highlights the geographical and missional expansion. Together, they illuminate the theological and historical progression of the early church as recorded in Acts."*
