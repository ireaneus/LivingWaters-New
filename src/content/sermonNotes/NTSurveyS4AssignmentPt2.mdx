**pg. 110 New Testament Survey Instructors Guide.**

**Read and compare Matthew 22:9 and Luke 14:23.**
1. In what ways do Luke and Matthew share a missionary interest?  
*"Luke and Matthew share a missionary interest by emphasizing the kingdom of God as inclusive and urgent, extending beyond Israel to those marginalized by society. Both highlight Jesus’ mission to break cultural barriers and invite all peoples into God’s kingdom."*

**Read the following verses and tell what they say about each category.**  
1. Women: Luke 7:12, 23:49, 55ff  
*"The prominence of women in the gospel accounts, especially as witnesses to the resurrection, would have been counterproductive for anyone attempting to fabricate a believable story in the ancient world. The inclusion of women points to the authenticity of the accounts, as the gospel writers faithfully recorded events as they occurred, regardless of cultural biases."*  

2. Children: Luke 7:12, 8:42, 9:38, 18:15  
**Luke 18:17 (NASB 2020)**:  
*“Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.”* 
*"Jesus teaches that we should have faith like a child—trusting, humble, and dependent—because such faith reflects the openness needed to embrace God’s kingdom."*

3. Social relations: Luke 7:36-50, 11:37-44, 14:1-4, 10:38-42, 19:1-10, 10:38-42, 11:5-8, 15:8-10, 22ff
*"Jesus values faith in Him above all, regardless of one’s cultural or societal status, affirming that those who trust in Him will find their place in His kingdom, where the last shall be first and the first last."*  

4. Poverty & wealth: Luke 6:20, 24, 30, 14:11ff
*"Jesus teaches that true blessing comes to those who are poor in spirit and rely on God, warning the wealthy of misplaced comfort in riches."*

5. Prayer: Luke 5:16, 6:12, 11:1-4 & 18:1-8
*"The Persistent Widow Parable underscores that God is far more willing to answer prayers than an unjust judge, but it calls believers to exhibit perseverance, faith, and trust in His perfect timing and justice."*

**Read Benware, Survey of the New Testament p. 99 and review the outline.**  

#### Look at the birth narrative events in Luke.
**Read Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels** *pp. 27-32*.

#### Write the sequence of events of Jesus’ birth and childhood years below.  
*Note* that there are apparent discrepancies such as Luke 2:39 returning them to Nazareth and Matthew 2:1ff Magi visiting Bethlehem.  

**Sequence of events of Jesus’ birth and childhood:**

Understand that after completing law, but before returning to Nazareth, all the events of Matthew took place and that they are supplemental to one another in regard to Jesus’ youth story. The introduction of Jesus through the temptation story is different from Matthew.

#### What are the differences and how do they relate to their respective audiences?

The Sermon on the Plain *Luke 6:20-49* is similar to the Sermon on the Mount. State the differences. 
*Note:* Jesus used similar figures to teach different points in different settings.  

**Read Luke 9:51**
#### What does the phrase ‘set His face resolutely’ mean for the rest of the story of Jesus?
*Note:* This is the key turn toward the passion story of Jesus. **Read Benware, Survey of the New Testament** *pp. 99, 107.*


Look at the Passion Week in **Thomas and Gundry, A Harmony of the Gospels**
beginning on *p. 223.*  
#### What are the parallels between the synoptic, especially Luke, and John?  

**Read Luke 24:36-53**, then compare that with *Acts 1:1-14*.
#### How is the author of both of these accounts telling the same story?
