### **John Chapter 2**  
**_In Chapter 2, Jesus_** performs His first miracle at the wedding in Cana, turning water into wine, and cleanses the temple in Jerusalem. At Cana, He reveals His glory, leading His disciples to believe in Him (*vs. 11*). **_Christ is presented as_** the one who has authority over creation and life, revealing Himself as *The Temple of God* (*vs. 19*). **_Believers should_** trust in His power to transform lives (*vs. 11*), and honor God’s holiness in worship.

### **John Chapter 3**  
**_In Chapter 3, Jesus_** teaches Nicodemus about the necessity of being born again to see the kingdom of God and declares God’s love for the world (*vs. 16*). John the Baptist also exalts Jesus (*vs. 30*). **_Christ is presented as_** the Son of God who gives eternal life to those who believe in Him (*vs. 15-16*), and the one who came not to judge the world but to save it (*vs. 17*). **_Believers are_** born again by the Spirit (*vs. 5-6*), live in the light of truth (*vs. 21*), and exalt Christ in their lives, letting Him increase while they decrease (*vs. 30*).

### **John Chapter 4**  
**_In Chapter 4, Jesus_** speaks with the Samaritan woman at the well, revealing Himself as the Messiah and teaching about true worship (*vs. 24*). He teaches His disciples about the urgency of spiritual harvest (*vs. 35*), and many Samaritans believe in Him after hearing the woman’s testimony and meeting Him. **_Christ is presented as_** the Living Water (*vs. 14*), the Messiah (*vs. 26*), and the Savior of the world (*vs. 42*). **_Believers should_** worship God in spirit and truth (*vs. 24*), share the gospel boldly (*vs. 39*), and work in His harvest, rejoicing when others come to know Him (*vs. 36*). 

### **John Chapter 5**  
**_In Chapter 5, Jesus_** heals a man at the pool of Bethesda, testifies the Father is working, even on the Sabbath, and declares that He and the Father are equal. John lists the testimonies confirming Jesus’ identity: **John the Baptist** (*vs. 33-35*), **The works of Jesus** (*vs. 36*), **The Father Himself** (*vs. 37*), **The Scriptures** (*vs. 39*). **_Christ is presented as_** equal to the Father and the one sent by the Father to do His work, whose identity is affirmed by these testimonies. **_Believers should_** heed Jesus’ words to *“Do not sin anymore”* (*vs. 14*), trust the multiple testimonies of who Christ is, and receive eternal life by believing in Him (*vs. 24*).

### **John Chapter 6**

His teaching, (*vs. 53*), offends many and reveals those who truly believe. **_Christ is presented as_** not coming to bring peace but a sword, the bread of life given for the salvation of the world (*vs. 51*), and the one who gives eternal life to all the Father has given Him (*vs. 39-40*). **_Believers should_** cry out to Him, *“Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life. We have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God”* (*vs. 68-69*).

### **John Chapter 7**

The man boldly testifies, *“One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see”* (*vs. 25*), and believes in Jesus as the Son of Man. **_Christ is presented as_** the Light of the world who opens both physical and spiritual eyes (*vs. 5, 39*). **_Believers should_** proclaim Christ’s transforming work in their lives, saying, *“Lord, I believe”* (*vs. 38*), and walk in His light, rejecting spiritual blindness.

### **John Chapter 10**
