**pg. 195 New Testament Survey Instructors Guide.**

#### Review what you know about the apostle Paul and his missionary journeys. What specific cities did he visit on each journey?

#### Identify the tone of each letter and tell how they are different from one another.

#### Identify the different pressures that these churches were facing when each of these letters were written.

#### How are these pressures like those facing the church and Christians today?

#### Compare **outlines** in *Benware, Survey of the New Testament* and *Nelson, Maps and Charts* with the material presented on the video.

#### Where does the key verse appear in Benware’s outline?

#### Discuss what is meant by a “different gospel” and how that was understood differently by the Galatian churches than the Thessalonian church.
