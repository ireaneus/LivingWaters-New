   - **Reason for the 70 Years**: 
     - *2 Chronicles 36:20-21* – The exile fulfilled the word of the LORD through Jeremiah, as the land rested for 70 years to account for the Sabbath years that were not observed during the 490 years of Israel’s disobedience.

     - *Jeremiah 25:11-12* – Prophecy that the land would lie desolate for 70 years.
   - **Significance of the 490 Years**: This period reflects the cumulative time of Israel’s rebellion against God’s covenantal commands, particularly neglecting the Sabbath year of rest. The *490 years* preceding the exile represented 70 missed Sabbaths (every seventh year), leading to the enforced rest during captivity.

### 9. **Return from Exile and Rebuilding (Approx. 538 B.C. Onward)**
