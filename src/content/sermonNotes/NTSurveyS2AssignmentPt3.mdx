### Exercise Assignment pp. 74

| Verse | Observation |
| ------ | ---------| 
| Mark 14:51 *A young man was following Him, wearing nothing but a linen sheet over his naked body; and they seized him. 52But he pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked.* | *This story is not mentioned anywhere else in the gospel and seems obvious that the writer John Mark was the young man.* |
| Acts 12:12ff *And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.* | *Common meeting place apparently she was well to do.  John Mark probably grew up in a home with a God fearing mother* |
| Col 4:10 *Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and also Barnabas’s cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him);* | *Mark was well known in the Church community with a home church and Barnabas's cousin, Paul had high regards for him, and he was a friend of Peter* |
| Philemon 24 *Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 24as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.* | *To be mentioned in a list from Paul by name and your name recorded in the Bible. A humble honor* |
| Acts 13:5 & 15:37-39 *When they reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John as their helper.* *Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also. 38But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. 39And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.* | *Then to be rebuked by Paul, because he was lazy?* |
| 2 Tim. 4:11 *Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.* | *Interesting that Mark is now useful to Paul at this time, back in Acts he was not* |
| 1 Pet 5:13 *She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark. * | *Peter considers Mark his son in the faith* |
| Acts 13:13 *Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem.* | *John Mark was a helper in 8 verses before, now he is going back to Jerusalem, so 2 chapters later, Paul must have rebuked Mark about going back to Jerusalem. He probably missed his mother, it sounds like this may have been his first mission trip?* |
