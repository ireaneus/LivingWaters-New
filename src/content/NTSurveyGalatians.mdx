**Chapter 2**  
**_In Chapter 2, Paul_** recounts his confrontation with Peter in Antioch over the issue of Gentile inclusion and defends justification by faith (*vs. 2:1-21*). **_Christ is presented as_** the one who justifies believers through faith, not works of the law (*vs. 2:16*). **_Believers should_** live by faith in Christ, who gave Himself for them (*vs. 2:20*).

### Freedom in Christ vs. 3:1-4:31

**Chapter 3**  
**_In Chapter 3, Paul_** explains that justification comes through faith, using Abraham as an example, and highlights the purpose of the law (*vs. 3:1-29*). **_Christ is presented as_** the fulfillment of the promise and the one who redeems us from the curse of the law (*vs. 3:13-14*). **_Believers should_** trust in faith alone for righteousness, not the works of the law (*vs. 3:6-7*).

**Chapter 4**  
**_In Chapter 4, Paul_** contrasts life under the law with life as children of God through faith in Christ and warns against returning to slavery under the law (*vs. 4:1-31*). **_Christ is presented as_** the one who makes us heirs through His redemption (*vs. 4:4-7*). **_Believers should_** stand firm in their freedom and live as heirs of God’s promises (*vs. 4:31*).

**Chapter 6**  
**_In Chapter 6, Paul_** encourages believers to bear one another’s burdens, sow to the Spirit, and boast only in the cross of Christ (*vs. 6:1-18*). **_Christ is presented as_** the one through whom we are crucified to the world and live as new creations (*vs. 6:14-15*). **_Believers should_** do good to all, especially fellow believers, and persevere in doing what is right (*vs. 6:9-10*).
